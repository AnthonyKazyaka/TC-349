The Vimeo homepage looks very smooth and sleek. The nav bar at the top that drops down adds a lot of functionality without cluttering up the screen. The transparent form to account creation also fits nicely and is surrounded by enough padding to have it stand out.
The site also employs different types of layouts on the same page. The layout at the top of the page is a single column layout, but as the user scrolls down, use of a gallery layout and also a two-column layout can be seen.
The buttons all look very clean and modern, and the sections of the website have full-width background pictures that add to the depth and feel of the website.
The site also contains a lot of information that can be found on the main page without crowding the user's vision. They make use of image, video, and information carousels, and they also have good separation of content by using padding and different backgrounds. Overall, it is a very polished site. (Except for the particle effect on the door that moves when the nav bar at the top drops down the additional options. That isn't as polished.)
