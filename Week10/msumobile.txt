The mobile MSU site is clean and sleek. The colors are predictably green and white, but also a lot of varying shades of gray. The sections of the site are well named, as they do what one would expect them to. In the News section, the stories are split up, showing the title and a brief description, as separate links that take you to more detailed stories. The About page gives links to the various facets of Michigan State University that the user may want to know about, and it is done, similar to the News section, by splitting up the information into small titles for links that help prevent the user from feeling overwhelmed.
Personally, I liked the Libraries page the most, as it had interesting and colorful icons next to the links in the page. The Video page also popped out, the thumbnails all demanding your attention.
The ability to customize your home page on the mobile site is something that I wouldn't have thought of, but very refreshing. There aren't many full sites that let you customize what you see, so for a mobile site to do it is definitely different, and in a good way.

I think the site would have benefitted from more information given in the People, Events, and Map sections. Each of these has a search bar, which is to be expected, but almost exclusively a search bar. People could have had some of the administrators or faculty that are being showcased and link to their informational page. Events could have had upcoming events that users could click on to find more information. The Map section could have had a relatively low resolution image of campus, and if a user clicks on it or searches something, a more in depth version could show up.

All in all, a clean and useful website for its purpose and, with some minor tweaks, could be excellent.
