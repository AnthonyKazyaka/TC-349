Happy Cog has a very clean and interesting website. Instead of using different pages and navigating to those pages through the navbar, they just bring you to a section within the page you already have up by scrolling to it.
There are also many images used in the page, such as logos and background images, and they are all very simple and elegant. There are no actual pictures on the page, which actually lends a sort of charm to the site.
The site also gives you all of the information you would want without crowding the view. There is ample space between all of the elements of the sections of a page so that you know that they are distinct items, but also related. The fixed scrollbar at the top complements the way the site handles navigation. It makes it easy to get to any point in the page quickly and with ease. 
The site is modern and sleek and uses different layout formats throughout the page to fit the situation. When trying to draw your attention to an element, it is usually bigger and not in the same row and/or column as another element. When things aren't as important, but are still worth mentioning, they are side by side or in some other similar layout. They also embed Google Maps at the bottom, showing locations and who there is to contact at each.
