The website for United Pixelworkers is sleek and simplistic. It has a lot of products shown on the home page set up in a gallery layout. All of the items in the gallery have a hover action that causes them to raise up slightly, falling back down when the mouse leaves the item. This gives a nice feel to the site and brings attention to the item that is being hovered over.
The shopping cart is also always in the upper right hand corner, which means the user always has easy access to the items he wants to purchase and edit his shopping cart with relative ease from anywhere on the pages that have products on them. The navigation bars and footers on the page are simple and modern, with the latter containing ways to contact the company via social media and learn more about them. The navbar gives the user several specific, and helpful, options to choose from to navigate around the site.
The colors used on the site don't clash, the design seems to be well thought out, and the addition of the sidebar to help narrow down T-shirt selections is a plus when so many options are given in such a condensed space.
