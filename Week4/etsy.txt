Everything on Etsy is very easy on the eyes, in terms of a color palette. All of the content is set up win grids and navigation menus, which is nice and convenient for the user. The most useful content is either on the home page given directly to the user when they navigate to the site, or it is linked to in one of the navigation menus.
The style of the site, because it is grid-based, shows some of the block-level elements, such as the primary toolbar close to the top of the page, as well as some of the inline elements, such as pictures. Clicking on one of the categories brings you to a selection of subcategories or items, set up in a grid with varied sizes of grid items.
The site also has social network integration for Facebook and Twitter and is shown prominently at the top of a category, but it seems as though it pushes other social networks to the wayside. Pinterest is linked to at the bottom, but it isn't eye-catching.
