Reddit has a mobile site that I would rank among the top few sites I go on through my phone. The site has almost the same feel as the full site. The text is really small and almost unreadable for many of the links at the top of the page. For most of the links and stories throughout the page, the text is actually a decent size. The page loads very quickly, and this is likely due to the majority of content on the page being text. The pictures and ads that are loaded are small and can be zoomed into a decent magnification without forcing the user to click the link. This is beneficial when signal or WiFi is not very strong or reliable. Other than the differeng text sizes, which I'm sure indicates popularity, the site is largely unchanged. The navigation still works the same way, and the content is all the same.

Overall, this familiarity leads to a pleasurable experience. The same general feel through the desktop and mobile sites allows the user to navigate with confidence and the pages load quickly. That being said, the site isn't perfect and there could have been more effort taken to insure that all of the text and links are readable regardless of the screen size.
