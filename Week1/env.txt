I chose my development environment to be Visual Studio 2010, Google Chrome, and the GitHub native application. Visual Studio was chosen because I tried several different variations of simple text editors and found that the Intellisense was incredibly useful. I had tried using Notepad in the past, which I didn't enjoy because it was too basic and didn't inform me of any options.  I installed Notepad++, but that was just a glorified version of Notepad made for writing code, not HTML pages, and though it had options to assist the developer, I didn't find it very easy or helpful. I also tried Sublime, but that was essentially the same as Notepad++.
I use Google Chrome as my primary browser to see the web pages I develop, and it really boils down to one reason: I already use Firefox for my everyday browsing and found it too cluttering if also trying to create web pages, and Internet Explorer, as a baseline, isn't always very cooperative.
Using the native GitHub application for Windows seems to be a lot easier for me to grasp, at least in comparison to the command prompt shell.
