What I don't like: The site is fairly plain looking at first glance, with a plain white background for 80% of the height of the page. The stories have a headline and a small description, which normally would work well, but my issue with it is that the descriptions are too short. There is a whole website to work with, and yet the descriptions are shorter than most tweets.

What I like: The website is easy to navigate and the content is set up in a logical fashion. There seems to be a ton of information on the site between the articles, the reading, and the About section. The layout of the homepage is nice in terms of content (minus the very short descriptions at times). The content is all laid out into grids.

My overall thoughts on the website are that it was done well and that the website is based on the user having a favorable experience. And it succeeds in most cases, but the home page seems barren with its white background and little islands of text, though the grid layout keeps order and makes up for it in some ways. However: this guy definitely knows what he's doing, and it shows.
