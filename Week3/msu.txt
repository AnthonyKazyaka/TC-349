The homepage of MSU is well done in my opinion. It is organized and gives the user all of the relevant information or where to find it as soon as you navigate to the site. The colors reflect the colors and spirit of Michigan State University, and it has a clean and professional slideshow of pictures and links. There are a lot of media elements, such as images, videos (or links to them), and where to contact them using popular social networking sites.
Something that could use some improvement is the "Colleges" page that is linked to through the "Academics" drop-down menu. It seems very basic int it's implementation of an unordered list and doesn't look extremely nice. That being said, it doesn't look awful. But it also doesn't look good.
Something that I would be interested in testing would be to try to load this site with a browser with more limited capabilities than most current web browsers and see how the look and layout of the site could change and this would reflect a person using an older operating system and browser combination.
Overall, this site is well executed, especially on the home page, but some pages that the home page directly links to could use some work.
